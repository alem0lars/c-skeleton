For each task there could be additional requirements\r\n(specified above).\r\n\r\nIf you don't want to use the build system you can always do the job manually.\r\n\r\n## Directory Conventions\r\n- out is where the program is built and maybe other artifacts are generated\r\n- tests will hold eventually tests\r\n- src hold the source code\r\n- tmp a temporary directory\r\n\r\n## Other informations\r\n- This project has a website: TODO\r\n\r\n","name":"c-skeleton","tagline":"C Skeleton"}
